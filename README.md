# Greetings
Welcome to the code for [http://matthewkschultz.com](http://matthewkschultz.com). <br />

This is an example of some recent code I have written (July 2020). The site is hosted out of an AWS S3 bucket. <br />
Please note that due to their size, the audio files have not been included in this repository.

## To Do List
* Allow music players to sit fixed at the bottom of the screen so they can be listened to while browsing other parts of the site.
* Spanish Language version.

## Available Scripts
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
